# The Effect of Competition on Statsitical Self-efficacy

## Citationless Literature Review
### The real-world problem
Math anxiety is an issue. As a country and a world we could probably benefit from increased mathematical proficency, but many people are "just not math people". And that's an issue. Math anxiety is a major contributor to that feeling of inability to learn math. Below are scatterplots from the 2012 PISA showing the relationship between math scores, anxiety, and self-efficacy. 

This first one is math anxiety (m_anxi) and mean math score. Clearly a negative relationship. As m_anxi increases, scores decrease. That's logical.

The next plot shows the same comparison but with mathematical self-efficacy (m_se). Opposite direction, as m_se increases so does the mean score. Interesting, the $R^2$ is nearly identical ($R^2_{m\_anxi} = 0.31, R^2_{m\_se} = 0.37$).

So, I argue that there is clearly some relationship between self-efficacy, anxiety, and math scores. It's logical and supported by prior research into all three areas. Notably, a model of math anxiety includes self-efficacy (Luttenberger, Wimmer, & Paechter, 2018, p. 313).

Both m_anxi and m_se are complex variables. There are too many working pieces, as evident from the figure above, to try and make inferences at this level. What I'm really interested in is how competition plays a role in this relationship. The relationship above is actually applied *ex post facto* as my inital interest was in competition and self-efficacy. Which is why I have a more solid ground on competition. 

## Competitive Taxonomy
![[tax_1.png | 200]] ![[tax_2.png| 200]] ![[tax_3.png | 200]]

Competition is more complex than adding a score board. Many studies with competition don't have a clear definition or structure to it. At least, they aren't reporting on it and don't considering these other elements. The above three images are visuals of the taxonomy I created for competition. I'm not trying to look at all of these areas with my dissertation, but I wanted to create this so I could report clearly on the sturcture of my game. 

![[tax_1.png]]

My study, as it is currently defined, is between anonymous and non-anonymous competition. Mainly because I've found two studies that already show some difference between these two conditions, but really I'm just picking an area on this model that I found easiest to create conditions around. 

## Research Questions and Study Design

RQ1: **What is the effect of presence (anonymous or non-anonymous) and outcome (winning or losing) on learners’ self-efficacy in a GBL context?**

RQ2: **Does losing anonymously have a lesser negative effect on learners’ self-efficacy compared to losing non-anonymously in a GBL context?**

### Experimental Design
The first question is obvious except for the winning and losing aspect. Most studies I've found looking at competition don't pay attention to whether a person wins or loses! This drives me nuts. Self-efficacy is dependent on the outcome, so any study looking at self-efficacy and competition *must* consider the outcome. But I would argue any study looking at competition should consider the outcome. Thus, I derived the following 2x2 experimental design:

### Illusory Oppoenents
But the most difficult thing is to control the win/loss condition. This is taken care of in the intervention. I'm creating a game to teach statistics. I won't dive deeply into the game design, but think Pokémon battles with an alchemy element where players are mixing ingredients (i.e., numbers) to create descriptive statistics that power their creature. 

![[game_design.png]]

I'm *hoping* to control the win/loss conditions by creating illusory opponents. The game would simulate a real-life player by having variable pauses while the "opponent" thinks about their next move and an adaptive score that keeps the "opponent's" close to the player's score (sometimes winning sometimes losing). 

The anonymous condition (A) has students in one room told they are playing against students very similar to them at a remote location. No information is shared about the other opponenet other than that they are about the same age. In the non-anoymous condition (NA) the participants are sat across from one another. They are told they are playing aginst the person across from them, but a divider is between them so they cannot see the other person during gameplay. They only see the opposite person during the beginning of the intervention. But all participants will be playing aginst the CPU. 

![[intervention_design.png]]

The fact that they are playing against the CPU (or a cold opponenet per my model) makes it seem like I'm actually addressing the upper level of the model. But the goal is to modify their perception. That'll be a distinction that has to be made clear. Yes, they are competing against a CPU, but they aren't aware that it's a CPU—hopefully. 

## Hypothesis
So, what's the expected outcome. Well, winning should naturally increase efficacy beliefs. Continual winning would have a bigger effect than winning and few and losing a few. In a perfect world all players would be evenly matched. When that's the case, then the win/loss probably doesn't have a huge effect. They think it was a close match and they can take away from support from knowing that they held their own. It should be a pretty significant difference in apparant skill-level. Not an total blow-out, but enough to make the participant think, "wow, what am I missing?".  

If there is a meaningful difference between the A and NA conditions, then I would expect to see the following outcomes:

![[hypot.png]]

The NA condition would have large gains in their self-efficacy post-gameplay and vice versa. The A condition, however, might not have as much gain in efficacy beliefs, but the differences between conditions would be smaller. In other words, in the case of a total blow-out, the damage to one's efficacy beliefs aren't as serious. 

This study would answer wether anonimity can offset negative effects on efficacy beliefs from losing in competition. And, it would also answer wether winning or losing have difference effects on efficacy beliefs. Although I feel strongly that it does, I haven't found any real experimental evidence that winning/losing can influence efficacy beliefs.
